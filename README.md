## 🔁 Liquidity Correction & Transparency Statement

During our early testing phase, 20,000,000 LVSP tokens were launched into the market with low liquidity (less than 0.5 SOL total).

This caused instability and a poor reflection of the token's value.

### ✅ What We Did:
- The founder manually re-purchased 7,100,000 LVSP from that batch.
- These tokens are now being reintegrated with a strong liquidity pool:  
  `1 SOL per 1,000,000 LVSP`.
- The remaining 12.9M tokens are either:
  - Inactive
  - Burned
  - Held by early supporters

### 📌 Lesson:
> We take full responsibility and commit to higher liquidity standards for all future launches.

Transparency is key — Solana blockchain records are open and verifiable. View transactions [on Solscan](https://solscan.io).

---

## 🔜 What's Next?

- 🔄 New liquidity pool with corrected ratio (live soon)
- 📱 TikTok, Telegram, GitHub and X (twitter) announcements
- 🧠 AI View prototype showcase (Q3)
- 📈 CEX listing plans begin after community vote (TBA)

## ⚠️ Important Update on Token Transparency and Security

The LavaSpoon (LVSP) team is committed to full transparency and maintaining the highest standards of security and trust within our community.  

We want to clarify that no rug pulls or scams have occurred — previous tokens (LAVSP) were burned to prevent any confusion or misuse.  

To further protect our community, we have locked major token allocations using verified Streamflow smart contracts, ensuring that marketing funds, team allocations, development budgets, community airdrops, and liquidity pools are fully locked and time-released transparently.
