## 🔁 Liquidity Correction & Transparency Statement

During our early testing phase, 20,000,000 LVSP tokens were launched into the market with low liquidity (less than 0.5 SOL total).

This caused instability and a poor reflection of the token's value.

### ✅ What We Did:
- The founder manually re-purchased 7,100,000 LVSP from that batch.
- These tokens are now being reintegrated with a strong liquidity pool:  
  `1 SOL per 1,000,000 LVSP`.
- The remaining 12.9M tokens are either:
  - Inactive
  - Burned
  - Held by early supporters

### 📌 Lesson:
> We take full responsibility and commit to higher liquidity standards for all future launches.

Transparency is key — Solana blockchain records are open and verifiable. View transactions [on Solscan](https://solscan.io).

---

## 🔜 What's Next?

- 🔄 New liquidity pool with corrected ratio (live soon)
- 📱 TikTok, Telegram, GitHub and X (twitter) announcements
- 🧠 AI View prototype showcase (Q3)
- 📈 CEX listing plans begin after community vote (TBA)
